#Knowledge-aware Fine-grained Attention Networks with Refined Knowledge Graph Embedding for Personalized Recommendation.
This is our Pytorch implementation for the paper:


## Introduction


## Requirement
The code has been tested running under Python 3.8.16. The required packages are as follows:
- torch == 2.0.1
- numpy == 1.24.4
- sklearn == 1.2.2

## Usage
The hyper-parameter search range and optimal settings have been clearly stated in the codes (see the parser function in src/main.py).
* Train and Test

```
python main.py 
```


## Dataset

We provide three processed datasets: Book-Crossing, MovieLens-1M, and Last.FM.

We follow the paper " [Ripplenet: Propagating user preferences on the knowledge
graph for recommender systems](https://github.com/hwwang55/RippleNet)" to process data.
